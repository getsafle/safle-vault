# **Safle Vault SDK**

Safle Vault is a non-custodial, flexible and highly available crypto wallet which can be used to access dapps, send/receive crypto and store identity. Vault SDK is used to manage the vault and provide methods to generate vault, add new accounts, update the state and also enable the user to perform several vault related operations.  


## **Installation and Usage**

> Installation

Install the package by running the command,

`npm install @getsafle/safle-vault`

Import the package into your project using,

`const Vault = require('@getsafle/safle-vault');`

Initialise the vault class,

```
const vault = new Vault({ 
    vault,
    customEncryptor: {
    // An optional object for defining encryption schemes:
    // Defaults to crypto-js library
    encrypt(password, object) {
      return encryptedString;
    },
    decrypt(password, encryptedString) {
      return decryptedData;
    },
  },
  platform,
  storage,
});
```

* `vault` (optional) - If the user already has a vault string generated, then it can be passed as the first parameter. If the vault string is not passed, then the vault has to be generated using the `generateVault()` function.
* `customEncryptor` (optional) - If the user wants to use their own custom encryption/decryption function.
* `platform` (optional) - The platform on which the vault sdk is integrated with. This data will be helpful for logging purpose.
* `storage` (optional) - The storage mechanism for vault. Can be an array of strings incase there are multiple storage mechanisms.

If the vault is not yet generated, then pass the `vault` parameter as null.
